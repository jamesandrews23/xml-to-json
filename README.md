# xml-to-json
Converts an XML document to a Javascript object. I used this to convert RSS feeds to a usable format.

I followed this conversion format:

Pattern XML	                         JSON	                                          Access
 1	<e/>	                            "e": null	                                    o.e
 2	<e>text</e>	                      "e": "text"	                                  o.e
 3	<e name="value" />	              "e":{"@name": "value"}	                      o.e["@name"]
 4	<e name="value">text</e>	        "e": { "@name": "value", "#text": "text" }	  o.e["@name"] o.e["#text"]
 5	<e> <a>text</a> <b>text</b> </e>	"e": { "a": "text", "b": "text" }	            o.e.a o.e.b
 6	<e> <a>text</a> <a>text</a> </e>	"e": { "a": ["text", "text"] }	              o.e.a[0] o.e.a[1]
 7	<e> text <a>text</a> </e>	        "e": { "#text": "text", "a": "text" }	        o.e["#text"] o.e.a
 

# Example

```javascript
import convertXmlToJSObj from 'xmltojsobjconverter';

let jsObj = convertXmlToJSObj("xmlDocString");
```

Here's an example of an rss feed I converted:
